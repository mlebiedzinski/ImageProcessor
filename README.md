# ImageProcessor
CS3500 Object Oriented Design <br> 
Assignment 6 <br> 
November, 2022 <br>

In this project, my partner and I were tasked with creating a image processing program that allowed a user to load in images and manipulate them in ways such as, blur, sharpen, flip, and many more, then save the image. Our code is organized following the MVC design pattern. We implemented the Command Design Pattern, to allow us to smoothly make enhacements to our code as the assignment progressed, such as implementing new image manipulation functions. We optimized our code to allow for a variety of user inputs. Lastly, utilizing the Swing framework, we built an interactive view with a graphical user interface to enable the user to view the image enhacements they are making.

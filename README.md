# ImageProcessor
CS3500 Assignment 6

In this project My partner and I were tasked with creating a image processing program that allowed a user to load images from their computer and edit them in ways such as, blur, shrpen, flip, and many more, and then save the image. Throughout the assignment we had to make many enhacements to our code such gradually implementing new image manipulation functions, allowing for a variety of user inputs, and adding a GUI.
